# Designborne - Rogue1988 based game

A retro game that is coded with purpose of strictly adhering to SOLID principles in OOP. Demonstrates good coding principles that is well documented with design rationales, UML diagrams and class diagrams.

# How it works
The game is an RPG game based on an old school fashioned console game (very literally console, the game is played in the terminal). The player is able to defeat monsters, where
there are drop chances. Dropped items can be collected and used by the player (buffs, regeneration, weapons). "Rune" is the currency used in game, where players can collect 
Runes after slaying monsters, which can be used with NPC's stationed around the map. 

Embark on your journey to slay the final boss, where players have to first defeat monsters and upgrade their weapons in order to find the key
to the underworld! The boss is waiting for your arrival, go ahead and begin your journey by running the game (and running back time) in the 
retro world!
